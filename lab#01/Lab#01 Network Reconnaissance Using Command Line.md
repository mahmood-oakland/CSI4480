### Common Rules

#### About lab work

* Every group (consisting of two members) should finish the lab independently. Discussion about the big picture is allowed among groups. 
* No print screen will be accepted for the answers unless mentioned otherwise, but it is a good habit to attach a screenshot to your answer in case you have a special situation where your observation is different from others but you have correctly operated.
* Each group should show that they understand what they are doing and ask the instructor or the TA when a question is unclear. **Please read the lab material before answering the questions.**
* No print screen will be accepted for the answers unless mentioned otherwise.



#### About submission

Please submit to **Moodle Submission** of Lab Footprinting link. 

* Turn in **one single PDF file per group**.
* Give it an **informative** name following the pattern `Lab#??_group#?.pdf`. For example, `Lab#01_group#1.pdf`.
* **No late submission will be accepted.** Contact the professor/TA for extension ahead in case of any exception.

## Lab Details

### Lab Objective

Network reconnaissance consists of multiple activities designed to map out the size and scope of targeted network using Internet utilities. For example to find out available servers, border routers, we can do basic network reconnaissance using `nslookup`, `ping` and `traceroute`.

#### NSLOOKUP

Refer to **Lab3.1A** in the book to complete the following hand-on activities.

Use **security lab computer** from now on.

##### Hand-on activities

1. In Windows, open a command prompt window.

2. Enter `nslookup` to begin operating in the interactive mode. Enter `exit` to exit whenever you want to.

   Note: You can lookup one host_name or IP address by running `nslook <host_name|ip_address>`, or in a interactive mode, just input `<host_name|ip_address>`. You are free to perform a lookup in either way.
